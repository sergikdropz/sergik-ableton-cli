## Production Characteristics

### 1. Groove-First Philosophy
- Rhythm drives composition decisions
- Kick/clap placement establishes foundation before melodics
- Swing and groove quantization applied intentionally

### 2. Multi-Layer Melodic Architecture
- Typical structure: 3+ melodic layers (lead 1, lead 2, lead 3)
- Layered approach creates depth without frequency collision
- Each layer occupies distinct spectral space

### 3. Spectral Separation Processing
- Heavy use of Multiband Dynamics for frequency-specific control
- Clean separation between bass, mids, and highs
- No mud in 200-400 Hz range

### 4. Gate-Tight Transients
- Gate applied per stem for clean transient control
- Removes bleed/noise between elements
- Creates punchy, defined sound

### 5. Send/Return as Compositional Elements
- Reverb and Delay recorded as discrete stems
- A-Reverb and B-Delay are automation targets
- Spatial FX treated as instruments, not just effects

### 6. Stem-Ready Architecture
- All productions exportable as individual stems
- Standard stem count: 7 (Vocals, Drums, Bass, Guitars, Keys, Perc, Other)
- Enables unlimited remix/re-automation potential
